# Software Engineer: RIAAN VAN DEVENTER (SN: RV22110005417)
# This was programmed for the Software Engineering BOOTCAMP
# Written on 11 January 2023
#
# ************** L2T13 - TASK ASSIGNMENT **************  
#
# - Create a program that can be used by a bookstore clerk. The program should allow the clerk to:
#   * add new books to the database
#   * update book information
#   * delete books from the database
#   * search the database to find a specific book.
# 
# - Create a database called ebookstore and a table called books. The table should have the following structure:
#   id      Title                                       Author              Qty
#   3001    A Tale of Two Cities                        Charles Dickens     30
#   3002    Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone    J.K. Rowling        40
#   3003    The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe        C. S. Lewis         25
#   3004    The Lord of the Rings                       J.R.R Tolkien       37
#   3005    Alice in Wonderland                         Lewis Carroll       12
#
# - Populate the table with the above values. You can also add your own values if you wish.
# - The program should present the user with the following menu:
#       1. Enter book
#       2. Update book
#       3. Delete book
#       4. Search books
#       0. Exit
#
# - The program should perform the function that the user selects. The implementation of these functions 
#   is left up to you, but a demonstration of the topics we have covered in the last module should be shown.
